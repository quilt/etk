# Expressions

## `push` opcodes

The `push` family of instructions require an immediate argument. Unlike most arguments (which come from the stack), immediate arguments are encoded in the bytes _immediately_ following the opcode.

For example, `push2 258` would assemble to `0x610102`. `0x61` is the instruction, and `0x0102` is the immediate argument. `push2` instructs the EVM to use the next two bytes `0x01` and `0x02` as input for the op. That value is left-padded with zeros to 32 bytes (so `0x0000...000102`) and placed on the stack.

While an assembled `push` must have a concrete value, it is often useful when developing a program to have the ability to manipulate the operand at compile time. For this reason, `push` opcodes take a single **expression** as their operand.

```rust
# extern crate etk_asm;
# extern crate etk_ops;
# let src = r#"
push1 1+(2*3)/4
# "#;
# let mut output = Vec::new();
# let mut ingest = etk_asm::ingest::Ingest::new(&mut output, etk_ops::HardFork::Cancun);
# ingest.ingest(file!(), src).unwrap();
# assert_eq!(output, &[0x60, 0x02]);
```

## Definition

An **expression** is a standard infix mathematical expression that is evaluated during assembly. Its computed value *must* fit within the preceding `push`'s size allowance (eg. less than 256 for `push8`). 

### Terms

Many different types of values are allowed as a term in an expression:

#### Integer Literals

Integer literals are described by the following Pest grammar:

```ignore
number   = _{ binary | octal | hex | decimal | negative }
decimal  = @{ ASCII_DIGIT+ }
negative = @{ "-" ~ ASCII_DIGIT+ }
binary   = @{ "0b" ~ ASCII_BIN_DIGIT+ }
hex      = @{ "0x" ~ ASCII_HEX_DIGIT ~ ASCII_HEX_DIGIT+ }
octal    = @{ "0o" ~ ASCII_OCT_DIGIT+ }
```

There is no limit for the length of integer literals. While expressions support
both signed and unsigned integers, the result of the expression must
non-negative and fit within the width of the corresponding `push` instruction.

#### Labels

A [label](ch03-labels.md) may be used as a term in an expression.

```rust
# extern crate etk_asm;
# extern crate etk_ops;
# let src = r#"
start:
    push1 start + 1
# "#;
# let mut output = Vec::new();
# let mut ingest = etk_asm::ingest::Ingest::new(&mut output, etk_ops::HardFork::Cancun);
# ingest.ingest(file!(), src).unwrap();
# assert_eq!(output, &[0x60, 0x01]);
```

#### Macros

[Expression macros](ch04-macros/ch02-expression.md) may be used as a term in an expression.

```rust
# extern crate etk_asm;
# extern crate etk_ops;
# let src = r#"
push4 selector("transfer(uint256,uint256)")
# "#;
# let mut output = Vec::new();
# let mut ingest = etk_asm::ingest::Ingest::new(&mut output, etk_ops::HardFork::Cancun);
# ingest.ingest(file!(), src).unwrap();
# assert_eq!(output, &[0x63, 12, 247, 158, 10]);
```

### Operators

#### Binary

Expressions support the following binary operators:

```rust
# extern crate etk_asm;
# extern crate etk_ops;
# let src = r#"
push1 1+2       # addition
push1 1*2       # multiplication
push1 2-1       # subtraction
push1 2/2       # division

# "#;
# let mut output = Vec::new();
# let mut ingest = etk_asm::ingest::Ingest::new(&mut output, etk_ops::HardFork::Cancun);
# ingest.ingest(file!(), src).unwrap();
# assert_eq!(output, &[0x60, 0x03, 0x60, 0x02, 0x60, 0x01, 0x60, 0x01]);
```
